Nonautonomous Noisy Slow-Fast Rosenzweig-MacArthur Predator-Prey System

Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a nonautonomous noisy slow-fast Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey system. The Rosenzweig-MacArthur model is a well-known predator-prey system in ecological modeling, and this implementation extends it by incorporating slow-fast dynamics, external noise, and time-dependent parameters.

Features

Slow-Fast System: The model incorporates distinct timescales for prey and predator populations.

Nonautonomous Dynamics: Time-dependent variations in system parameters are included.

Noisy Environment: Stochastic perturbations are introduced to analyze system behavior under uncertainty.

Numerical Simulations: The code provides tools to integrate the system numerically and analyze its behavior under different conditions.
