[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/924260081.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15454596)

## Overview
This repository provides an implementation of a **nonautonomous noisy slow-fast Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey system**, a model designed to capture the complex dynamics of predator-prey interactions under external perturbations and multiple timescales. This system extends the classic Rosenzweig-MacArthur framework by incorporating time-dependent parameters and stochastic fluctuations, making it particularly useful for studying ecological resilience and instability in fluctuating environments.

## Features
- **Slow-Fast Dynamics**: Incorporates distinct timescales to represent the different speeds of prey and predator population changes.
- **Nonautonomous Behavior**: Allows system parameters to evolve over time, simulating seasonal or environmental variations.
- **Stochastic Effects**: Introduces noise to analyze the impact of environmental randomness on ecosystem stability.
- **Numerical Simulation Tools**: Provides functions for numerical integration and analysis of system trajectories under various conditions.
- **Visualization**: Includes tools to generate time series plots, phase portraits, and bifurcation diagrams for better system analysis.
